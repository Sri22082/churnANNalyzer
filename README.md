# ChurnANNalyzer: Advanced Customer Churn Prediction with Artificial Neural Networks

## Project Overview
ChurnANNalyzer is a sophisticated customer churn prediction project that employs an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. This project is designed to analyze customer data, identify churn patterns, and predict customer churn with high accuracy. It effectively addresses challenges such as imbalanced datasets and categorical variable processing to enhance predictive performance.

## Key Features
- **Handling Imbalanced Data**: Implements advanced techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to manage imbalanced data, ensuring robust and accurate predictions even when the churn class is underrepresented.
- **One-Hot Encoding**: Utilizes one-hot encoding for preprocessing the dataset, converting categorical variables into binary vectors, which enhances the model's capability to process and interpret categorical data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducts comprehensive exploratory data analysis to uncover valuable insights, identify patterns, and understand key factors influencing customer churn.
- **ANN Model Building**: Constructs a powerful Artificial Neural Network model to predict customer churn, achieving a commendable accuracy rate of 86%.

## Results
The Artificial Neural Network model achieves a high accuracy of 86% in predicting customer churn. For detailed performance metrics and evaluation results, refer to the `Churn_Prediction.ipynb` notebook.
